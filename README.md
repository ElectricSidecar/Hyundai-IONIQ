# Hyundai IONIQ

## FAQ

[Does anyone know why the original Hyundai Ioniq has such low battery degradation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/175t8vk/does_anyone_know_why_the_original_hyundai_ioniq/): Explains why the SOH parameter tends to stay at 100% longer than expected.

> Yes, there's a 3kwh buffer. While the available capacity is 28kwh,the real battery capacity is 31kwh. The BMS will always measure 100% if the total battery capacity is 28 or higher (buffer included). So it will only go under 100% if the buffer gets depleted and the total battery capacity goes under 28, which means over 3kwh loss.
